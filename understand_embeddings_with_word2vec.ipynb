First, build the entire pipeline to have a baseline evaluation of your task. **Then, and only then, improve your data cleaning and _watch_ if it is really improving your score**. Otherwise, if you work on your data cleaning without baseline evaluation of your performances, you don't know whether your fancy data cleaning is improving the entire pipeline or not. And sometimes, it can get super counterintuitive ;)\n",

For that reason, you can start with 20% of the sentences and see if your computer handles it. Otherwise, rerun with a lower number. On the other hand, you can increase the number if you feel like it.
